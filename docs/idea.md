# FocusPulse, an iOS app to help you focus and get things done

## Description

FocusPulse is a minimal Pomodoro focus timer.

## Features

- Pomodoro focus timer
- Minimalist design
- No art assets required—only Swift UI primitives and SF Symbols.

## Why it’s a good fit

- Tiny surface area: one main screen + optional stats sheet.
- Visually clean: uses built-in circular ProgressView, Text, and SF Symbols (play.fill, pause.fill, stop.fill).

Adds a small twist: auto-cycles work/short-break/long-break sessions and logs how many you finish each day.

Perfect for Cursor: AI code-generation can scaffold the model and tests in minutes.
