## [System Design Document Guidelines](mdc:pplx:/action/followup)

When assisting with or generating system design documents, adhere to the following principles:

1. **[Completeness](mdc:pplx:/action/followup)**: Ensure all aspects of the system are covered.
   - Architecture overview
   - Detailed component descriptions
   - Data flow and process diagrams
   - Interface specifications
   - Security considerations
   - Performance requirements
   - Scalability and reliability plans

2. **[Accuracy](mdc:pplx:/action/followup)**: Provide precise and current technical information.
   - Use correct technical terminology
   - Reflect the latest industry standards and best practices
   - Verify compatibility of proposed technologies

3. **[Clarity](mdc:pplx:/action/followup)**: Present information in a clear, understandable manner.
   - Use plain language where possible
   - Explain complex concepts thoroughly
   - Provide examples and analogies when helpful

4. **[Structure](mdc:pplx:/action/followup)**: Organize the document logically.
   - Use consistent headings and subheadings
   - Include a table of contents
   - Provide cross-references where appropriate

5. **[Visuals](mdc:pplx:/action/followup)**: Incorporate diagrams and visual aids.
   - System architecture diagrams
   - Flowcharts and sequence diagrams
   - Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)
   - UML diagrams where applicable

6. **[Traceability](mdc:pplx:/action/followup)**: Link design decisions to requirements.
   - Reference relevant business or functional requirements
   - Explain rationale behind key design choices

7. **[Risk Assessment](mdc:pplx:/action/followup)**: Identify and address potential issues.
   - Highlight technical risks and mitigation strategies
   - Discuss trade-offs in design decisions

8. **[Future-Proofing](mdc:pplx:/action/followup)**: Consider scalability and extensibility.
   - Discuss how the system can evolve over time
   - Address potential future integrations

9. **[Technical Depth](mdc:pplx:/action/followup)**: Provide detailed technical specifications.
   - Database schema designs
   - API specifications
   - Network topology
   - Infrastructure requirements

10. **[Implementation Guidance](mdc:pplx:/action/followup)**: Offer insights for development.
    - Suggest development approaches
    - Highlight critical algorithms or data structures
    - Propose testing strategies

11. **[Compliance and Standards](mdc:pplx:/action/followup)**: Address relevant regulations and standards.
    - Industry-specific compliance requirements
    - Data protection and privacy considerations
    - Adherence to coding and documentation standards

12. **[Review and Iteration](mdc:pplx:/action/followup)**: Encourage document refinement.
    - Suggest areas for peer review
    - Highlight sections that may need regular updates

13. **[Design Validation and Consistency Testing](mdc:pplx:/action/followup)**: Verify implementation feasibility.
    - Cross-reference data types between database schemas and frontend interfaces
    - Validate API request/response formats against consuming components
    - Check for variable name consistency across system boundaries
    - Ensure data transformation compatibility between layers (e.g., database → API → frontend)
    - Identify potential serialization/deserialization issues
    - Verify that proposed integrations are technically compatible
    - Test design assumptions against real-world constraints and limitations

Remember to tailor the document to the specific needs of the project, its scale, and the intended audience. Always strive for a balance between technical depth and overall understandability.

## [System Designer/Architect Principles](mdc:pplx:/action/followup)

When working on system design and architecture for any component, follow this structured approach:

**Think step-by-step about the design and architecture for [component name]. Consider:**
- **Data flow**: How information moves through the component and between related systems
- **Key functions or classes**: Core functionality and the primary interfaces/abstractions needed
- **Potential challenges**: Technical limitations, performance bottlenecks, and complexity concerns
- **Integration with other components**: Dependencies, APIs, communication patterns, and data exchange protocols

This methodical approach ensures comprehensive coverage of all architectural aspects and helps identify potential issues early in the design process.

## [Code Generation Best Practices for AI Agents](mdc:pplx:/action/followup)

When generating code for AI agents or any development task, adhere to these standards:

**Generate [language] code for [specific functionality]. Include:**
- **Input/output types**: Clearly defined parameter types, return values, and data structures
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with meaningful error messages and appropriate fallback strategies
- **Detailed inline comments**: Step-by-step explanations of the logic, algorithm decisions, and any complex operations
- **Any necessary imports or dependencies**: All required libraries, modules, and external dependencies with version specifications where applicable

These practices ensure that generated code is:
- Maintainable and self-documenting
- Robust with proper error management
- Ready for production use with minimal modifications
- Easily understood by other developers and AI systems
